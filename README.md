some practice with canvas using vanilla JavaScript

I usually use P5js  but I am getting some practice with the html5 canvas 2d context

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D


I have put a lot of comments in the code highlighting the differences

between P5 and the vanilla 2d api


some helpful video are from Frank's Laboratory Videos
